## Mini Assignments

### 1. Currying
Implementation of currying technique in JavaScript - transforming functions that take multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument.

### 2. Debouncing
Demonstrates debouncing functionality to delay function execution until after a specified time has passed since the last invocation. Useful for search inputs and API calls.

### 3. Deep Clone
Implementation of deep cloning objects in JavaScript, creating independent copies of nested objects and arrays without reference sharing.

### 4. Event Emitter
Custom event emitter implementation allowing objects to emit events and register listeners, similar to Node.js EventEmitter pattern.

### 5. Mini Assignment 7-8
Combined assignment featuring:
- Custom array methods implementation (map, filter, reduce)
- Local storage management for data persistence
- Todo application with priority levels and completion tracking

### 6. Promises
Exploration of JavaScript promises, async/await patterns, and handling asynchronous operations with proper error handling.

### 7. Throttle
Implementation of throttling technique to limit function execution to once per specified time interval, commonly used for scroll and resize events.
